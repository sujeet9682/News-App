### Features & Technologies Used:  
### API Fetching**: Used `fetch()` to retrieve news data efficiently.  
### Modern JavaScript (ES6+)**: Utilized `forEach`, template literals, and `async/await`.  
### Promise Handling**: Managed API responses using `async/await` for cleaner asynchronous operations.  
### DOM Manipulation**: Dynamically created elements via JavaScript for performance and security.  
### Session Storage**: Cached data in `sessionStorage` to reduce redundant API calls. 
### Infinite Scroll**: Implemented lazy loading to fetch more news as the user scrolls down.
